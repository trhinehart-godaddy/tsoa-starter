# Example API

This is an example API that uses [TSOA](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa) to generate a `swagger.json` and expose
a [Swagger UI](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/).

## Run Locally

```bash
npm run local
```

Once you start the server, you can view the Swagger UI
at [http://localhost:3000/api-docs/](http://localhost:3000/api-docs/). You can also view the `swagger.json`
at [http://localhost:3000/swagger.json](http://localhost:3000/swagger.json) which [clients](../client/README.md) can use
to generate language specific libraries.
